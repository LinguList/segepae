Less is known about what is being taught in undergraduate sexuality courses today; this study sought to fill that gap. Reviewing content based on 161 courses (provided by 150 different instructors) from all regions of the USA, this study examined overall descriptions of course content and pedagogical strategies in relation to the academic position of the instructor, region of the country and course enrolment size. Results indicated similar content and pedagogical strategies employed with limited differences based on demographic characteristics. The most commonly taught subjects were sexual orientation (95.0{\\%}), communication (93.8{\\%}), gender identity (93.2{\\%}) and gender roles (93.2{\\%}). Most courses included reference to contraception (89.4{\\%}), HIV and AIDS (88.2{\\%}) and STIs (85.7{\\%}).

Analyses conducted using data from 66 adjudicated cases of child sexual assault from the County Court of Victoria, Australia revealed that longer sentences were handed down to offenders who had perpetrated multiple offences, or who had committed offences against younger children. Lower levels of victim credibility were associated with shorter sentences and earlier parole dates for offenders, which were also associated with the presence of more harmful behavioural indicators of abuse.

This study examines the extent to which offence characteristics (such as the number of offences, number and age of victims), the behaviour and perceived credibility of the victim impact upon both sentence length and the setting of earliest parole dates. Analyses conducted using data from 66 adjudicated cases of child sexual assault from the County Court of Victoria, Australia revealed that longer sentences were handed down to offenders who had perpetrated multiple offences, or who had committed offences against younger children. Lower levels of victim credibility were associated with shorter sentences and earlier parole dates for offenders, which were also associated with the presence of more harmful behavioural indicators of abuse. The findings are discussed regarding the importance of presenting evidence about the behaviour of victims following sexual abuse in criminal trials.",

    "freetext": "systematic review and meta-analysis of literature were conducted examining the effectiveness of the national institute for child health and human development investigative interview protocol in improving the quality of child forensic interviews. online databases were searched for journal articles published between the years 2000 and 2013. measures of interview quality were the type of interviewer utterances and the amount of information provided by children. five studies met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. weighted mean of the effect sizes was calculated for each outcome measure. protocol interviews had more invitations (g = 1.60) and fewer option-posing (g = -.95) and suggestive prompts (g = -.63) than standard interviews. children interviewed by the protocol provided more central details (g = .90) in response to invitations than controls. meta-analyses of a subset of preschool children samples revealed that protocol interviews had more invitations (g = 1.46), fewer suggestive prompts (g = -.61), and fewer option-posing prompts (g = -1.05) than controls. findings corroborate results from previous studies that suggested the benefits of the protocol on the interviewers' performance and on children's informativeness. however, protocol did not show the same performance with regard to preschool children. benia, luis roberto and hauck-filho, nelson and dillenburg, mariana and stein, lilian milnitsky 2015 the nichd investigative interview protocol: a meta-analytic review child, preschool;humans;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;kinder;national institute of child health and human development (u.s.)/standards;research report/standards;sexueller kindesmissbrauch;united states 259-279 24 3 1053-8712 journal of child sexual abuse 10.1080/10538712.2015.1006749 article    benia, l., n. hauck-filho, m. dillenburg, and l. stein l. benia, n. hauck-filho, m. dillenburg, l. stein benia, l. et al. benia et al. benia et al."

The current study, with a sample of 531 sixth-grade students (45\\% boys) attending ethnically diverse middle schools, used a resource control framework to explore which self-reported behaviors (e.g., empathy and aggression) and peer-reported status (e.g., acceptance and perceived popularity) predict the likelihood of being considered romantically desirable (i.e., receiving at least one \\dqcrush\\dq nomination from an opposite sex grademate). Self-reported empathy was positively associated with students' romantic desirability (primarily for those with high peer acceptance), whereas self-reported aggression on its own did not. Both peer-acceptance and popularity also were positively associated with students' romantic desirability, and aggressive behavior reduced popularity's effect. Although aggression may be integral for obtaining high peer status across cultures, prosocial behaviors were romantically valued. Our findings suggest that peer-vetted social status elicits romantic interest and during early adolescence, nice guys and gals really do not finish last.",

    "freetext": "african american juveniles adjudicated for sexual offenses may struggle with the mistrust of both the judicial and treatment systems. unlike general mental health services, juvenile sex offender treatment is often mandated by the court or child welfare services, thus these youths and their families must engage in the treatment process. without clinicians and services that can acknowledge and respond to a minority youth's experience in a sensitive, culturally competent manner, there could be significant resistance to treatment. traditional treatment approaches fail to prioritize issues involving cultural competence. this article addresses the unique challenges of african american juvenile sex offenders and makes recommendations for creating culturally competent practice for these youth and their families. venable, victoria m. and guada, joseph 2014 culturally competent practice with african american juvenile sex offenders criminals/psychology;cultural competency;humans;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;juvenile delinquency/psychology;kinder;male;psychiatrie // psychiatric;schwarz // black;sex offenses/ethnology;sexueller kindesmissbrauch 229-246 23 3 1053-8712 journal of child sexual abuse 10.1080/10538712.2014.888122 article    venable, v. and j. guada v. venable, j. guada venable and guada venable, v. and j. guada venable &amp; guada"

A cross-sectional web-based survey of 336 professionals before they received the game sought to measure their intention to use SeCZ TaLK, their attitudes towards discussing sexuality, social professional environment, self-efficacy, opinion on the feasibility of using the game and experience discussing sexuality. Actual use of SeCZ TaLK was assessed at follow-up (N = 105). Professionals with higher self-efficacy and more experience in discussing sexual health were more likely to intend to use the game.

    "freetext": "because sexual assault is often defined in terms of nonconsent, many prevention efforts focus on promoting the clear communication of consent as a mechanism to reduce assault. yet little research has specifically examined how sexual consent is being conceptualized by heterosexual college students. in this study, 185 midwestern u.s. college students provided responses to open-ended questions addressing how they define, communicate, and interpret sexual consent and nonconsent. the study aimed to assess how college students define and communicate consent, with particular attention to gender differences in consent. results indicated no gender differences in defining consent. however, there were significant differences in how men and women indicated their own consent and nonconsent, with women reporting more verbal strategies than men and men reporting more nonverbal strategies than women, and in how they interpreted their partner's consent and nonconsent, with men relying more on nonverbal indicators of consent than women. such gender differences may help to explain some misunderstandings or misinterpretations of consent or agreement to engage in sexual activity, which could partially contribute to the occurrence of acquaintance rape; thus, a better understanding of consent has important implications for developing sexual assault prevention initiatives. jozkowski, kristen n. and peterson, zo\\\"e d. and sanders, stephanie a. and dennis, barbara and reece, michael 2014 gender differences in heterosexual college students' conceptualizations and indicators of sexual consent: implications for contemporary sexual assault prevention education geschlecht // gender;konsens // consent;pr\\\"avention // prevention;sexuelle bildung // sexuality education;student*innen // college students;universit\\\"at // college university 904-916 51 8 1559-8519 the journal of sex research article    jozkowski, k., z. peterson, s. sanders, b. dennis, and m. reece k. jozkowski, z. peterson, s. sanders, b. dennis, m. reece jozkowski, k. et al. jozkowski et al. jozkowski et al."

    "freetext": "the paper thematises children's engendering and sexualisation in new media environments, and their ambivalent attitudes toward commercial (porno)sexuality constructions. the inquiry into adaptation to dominant gender identity and sexuality prescriptions in spite of children's ambivalences is contextualised by the critical analysis of grand quantitative survey research in the eu kids online ii framework. it is argued that gender and sexuality norms introduced by the epistemological, methodological and interpretative input of the research do not transcend the dominant matrices. according to the slovenian ethnographic research, school children exhibit criticism towards the intrusive and exploitative character of certain new media commercial contents, and this is not included in the analysed referential quantitative survey in any way. as a consequence, childhood remains conceptualised as a state of societal passivity in this context, which brings more disadvantages to girls in new media relations. besides, the grand quantitative survey research critiqued here supports hypocritical eu sector policies , which have become tolerant of new media-related capital interests, while minors' protection responsibilities are exhibited mainly on a declarative level -- as it is the case with the research epistemology under discussion. the same has been established regarding the application of a gender-sensitive approach in the research methodology and interpretation. \\vsribar, renata 2013 growing-up challenged and challenging: gender and sexuality norms in referential research on `internet risks' and in children geschlecht // gender;kinder;medien // media;sexualisierung // sexualization 129-145 21 1 1468-1366 pedagogy, culture \\& society 10.1080/14681366.2012.748681 article    \\vsribar, r. r. \\vsribar \\vsribar, r. \\vsribar \\vsribar"

Five semistructured focus groups (N = 30 LGBTQ participants) were conducted to investigate the sexuality education experiences of LGBTQ youth and to solicit youth suggestions for improving the inclusiveness of sexuality education curricula. Results indicate that LGBTQ youth perceive current sexuality education as primarily ``exclusive,'' although examples of ``inclusive'' sexuality education were provided. In addition, participants provided suggestions for creating a more inclusive experience, such as directly discussing LGBTQ issues, emphasizing sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention over pregnancy prevention, and addressing healthy relationships. Educators and policymakers can use these ideas to help improve the quality of sexuality education---not only to make it more inclusive for LGBTQ youth but to make sexuality education more inclusive for all young people.},\n    author = {Gowen, L.

While most scholars and practitioners uniformly concur about the scope of the problem, there is currently little agreement about how to prevent sexual violence before it occurs. Drawing on diverse disciplines such as criminology, education, health promotion, law, psychology, social work, socio-legal studies, sociology and women's studies, this book provides the first interdisciplinary collection on the primary prevention of sexual violence. The volume addresses the key causes or determinants of sexual violence, including cultural attitudes, values, beliefs and norms, as well as systemic gender-based inequalities that create the conditions underlying much violence against women. Including contributions from internationally renowned experts in the field, the volume critically investigates the theoretical underpinnings of prevention work, describing and analysing the limits and possibilities of primary prevention strategies 'on the ground'. The chapters collectively examine the role that structural violence and gender inequality play in fostering a 'culture' of sexual violence, and reflect on the relationship between macro and micro levels for understanding both sexual violence perpetration and prevention.

    "freetext": "despite high rates of gendered violence among youth, very few young women report these incidents to authority figures. this study moves the discussion from the question of why young women do not report them toward how violence is produced, maintained, and normalized among youth. the girls in this study often did not name what law, researchers, and educators commonly identify as sexual harassment and abuse. how then, do girls name and make sense of victimization? exploring violence via the lens of compulsory heterosexuality highlights the relational dynamics at play in this naming process. forensic interviews with youth revealed patterns of heteronormative scripts appropriated to make sense of everyday harassment, violence, coercion, and consent. findings inform discussions about the links between dominant discourses and sexual subjectivities as we try to better understand why many regard violence a normal part of life. hlavka, h. r. 2014 normalizing sexual violence: young women account for harassment and abuse jugendliche und junge erwachsene;sexuelle bel\\\"astigung // sexual harassment;sexueller missbrauch // sexual abuse;vergewaltigung // rape 337-358 28 3 0891-2432 gender \\& society 10.1177/0891243214526468 article    hlavka, h. h. hlavka hlavka, h. hlavka hlavka"

Depending upon how such exploitation is defined and measured, divergent estimates indicate that in the U.S. between 3 and 37 percent of males, and between 8 and 71 percent of females are sexually abused in some manner during childhood or adolescence. In response, governments have passed strict laws, entered into international treaties, and established large bureaucracies aimed at curbing child sexual abuse. This book the first to critically evaluate national and international efforts to reduce child sexual abuse (CSA) and ameliorate its effects. Until now, input from social science and mental health experts has been accepted for the most part uncritically, as have the programs and laws that have been developed in reliance upon that advice. Here Dr. Ewing utilizes empirical data, policy considerations, cost-benefit analyses, psychologicaltheory, legal reasoning, and common sense to undertake the often difficult and sometimes controversial task of distinguishing prevention strategies that are likely to prevent CSA from those that are not. He concludes that the most expensive preventive strategies- such as sex offender registration, enhancing criminal penalties for such offenders, and civilly confining them- are not effective in preventing CSA and may actually increase its likelihood. However, he also concludes that many other strategies are or could be effective in preventing CSA, such as minimizing opportunities for such abuse, risk education, teaching children to protect themselves, encouraging bystander intervention, limiting the cultural sexualization of children, improving the investigation and prosecution of CSA allegations, using technology to stop child pornography and to rescue its victims, changing the culture in child-serving organizations, and more. This volume will be a unique and critical resource for lawyers, researchers, psychologists, social workers, public policy officials, students, and child advocates interested in preventing child sexual abuse. -- Publisher description},\n    author = {Ewing, Charles Patrick},\n    year = {2014},\n    title = {Preventing the sexual victimization of children: Psychological, legal, and public policy perspectives},\n    keyword = {Bildungspolititk // education policies;Gesetzlich / legal;institutioneller Missbrauch // institutional abuse;Katholizismus // catholicism;Policies;Prostitution;sexuelle Gewalt // sexual violence;sexueller Kindesmissbrauch;Sicherheit // safety;Soziale Arbeit und Dienste // social work and services;Strafrecht // criminal justice;Vulnerabilit{\\\"a}t // vulnerability},\n    address = {Oxford and New York},\n    publisher = {Oxford University Press},\n    isbn = {9780199895533}\n}",

Depending upon how such exploitation is defined and measured, divergent estimates indicate that in the U.S. between 3 and 37 percent of males, and between 8 and 71 percent of females are sexually abused in some manner during childhood or adolescence. In response, governments have passed strict laws, entered into international treaties, and established large bureaucracies aimed at curbing child sexual abuse. This book the first to critically evaluate national and international efforts to reduce child sexual abuse (CSA) and ameliorate its effects. Until now, input from social science and mental health experts has been accepted for the most part uncritically, as have the programs and laws that have been developed in reliance upon that advice. Here Dr. Ewing utilizes empirical data, policy considerations, cost-benefit analyses, psychologicaltheory, legal reasoning, and common sense to undertake the often difficult and sometimes controversial task of distinguishing prevention strategies that are likely to prevent CSA from those that are not. He concludes that the most expensive preventive strategies- such as sex offender registration, enhancing criminal penalties for such offenders, and civilly confining them- are not effective in preventing CSA and may actually increase its likelihood. However, he also concludes that many other strategies are or could be effective in preventing CSA, such as minimizing opportunities for such abuse, risk education, teaching children to protect themselves, encouraging bystander intervention, limiting the cultural sexualization of children, improving the investigation and prosecution of CSA allegations, using technology to stop child pornography and to rescue its victims, changing the culture in child-serving organizations, and more. This volume will be a unique and critical resource for lawyers, researchers, psychologists, social workers, public policy officials, students, and child advocates interested in preventing child sexual abuse. -- Publisher description",

All participants had experiences with this kind of conflict, and nearly a third had been the subject of other girls' rumors about their own sexual actions and/or orientations. Their accounts indicate that sexual drama offers girls a socially acceptable site for making claims to, and sense of, gendered sexuality in adolescence. While they reproduce inequality through these practices, sexual drama is also a resource for girls---one that is made useful through the institutional constraints of their high schools, which reinforce traditional gender norms and limit sexuality information.},\n    author = {Miller, S.

Their accounts indicate that sexual drama offers girls a socially acceptable site for making claims to, and sense of, gendered sexuality in adolescence.

Intervention programs should focus on the care that children receive following sexual abuse, with particular emphasis on how emotion regulation abilities may be impacted.",

    "freetext": "at present, australian sex(uality) education curricula aim to equip students with information which facilitates `healthy' sexual choices as they develop. however, this is not neutral information, but rather socially and culturally regulated discourse which encodes a normative binary of sexuality. the largely us-focused sexuality education literature tends to categorise curricula as belonging to either `comprehensive' or `conservative' factions, consisting of progressive, secular approaches or religious- or abstinence-based programmes, respectively. neither of these factions, however, appear to be able to cater for the integration of issues relevant to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (glbtiq) students nor does this binary conceptualisation represent the reality of australian sexuality education policy and practice. this paper argues that contemporary sexuality education has a fundamentally neoliberal focus, which aims to assimilate glbtiq people into existing normative frameworks (economic and social), rather than challenge them. such an approach does not foster critical student understandings of oppression, power or morality. the development of critical literacy around sexuality is regarded as essential to meaningfully address the complex needs of glbtiq students. the paper explores missing queer discourses within australian teaching resources. the inclusion of these would benefit glbtiq students by bringing previously silenced issues to the fore. shannon, barrie 2016 comprehensive for who? neoliberal directives in australian `comprehensive' sexuality education and the erasure of glbtiq identity queer;sexuelle bildung // sexuality education 573-585 16 6 1472-0825 sex education: sexuality, society and learning 10.1080/14681811.2016.1141090 article    shannon, b. b. shannon shannon, b. shannon shannon"

    "freetext": "this study investigated feelings, reasons, pressures, and previous sexual experiences reported by students who have not had sexual intercourse and how these factors are associated with self-rated likelihood of having sex during the next year. using data from the fifth national survey of australian secondary students and sexual health (n = 783), this study found, in general, students had positive feelings about not having sex. reasons for not having sex such as being proud to say no and not being ready were rated higher in importance than fear of potential outcomes or religious/cultural beliefs. students reported limited pressure from parents and friends and, despite not having sexual intercourse, more than half of the sample had experienced some form of sexual activity. stronger likelihoods of having sex during the next year were reported by students who had previously engaged in other sexual practices, reported more pressure from friends to have sex, and had negative feelings about not having sex. sexuality educators can use these findings to guide approaches to sex education, emphasizing feelings, intentions, and reasoning over fear tactics. discussion of a range of sexual practices will address more closely the experiences of young students as they begin their sexual lives. heywood, wendy and patrick, kent and pitts, marian and mitchell, anne 2016 \\dqdude, i'm seventeen ... it's okay not to have sex by this age\\dq: feelings, reasons, pressures, and intentions reported by adolescents who have not had sexual intercourse gef\\\"uhle // emotions;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;sexuelle erfahrung // sexual experience 1207-1214 53 9 1559-8519 the journal of sex research 10.1080/00224499.2015.1092105 article    heywood, w., k. patrick, m. pitts, and a. mitchell w. heywood, k. patrick, m. pitts, a. mitchell heywood, w. et al. heywood et al. heywood et al."

    "freetext": "understanding the pathways and circumstances of juvenile sexual offending is of utmost importance. however, juvenile sexual offenders (jso) represent an especially diverse group of individuals, and several categorizations have been proposed to obtain more homogeneous subgroups. victim age-based and family relation-based categorizations are particularly promising because they seem theoretically and clinically relevant. empirical results however are still inconsistent, and most studies have not considered these two dimensions jointly. the first goal of this study was to further examine the value of subgrouping jso according to the age of their victim. a second goal was to determine the supplementary value, if any, of considering sibling incest. based on a sample of 351 male jso, it was first confirmed that sexual abuse of children was more strongly related to asociality (social skill deficits) than sexual abuse of peers, the latter being more closely associated with antisociality (general delinquency). the relevance of considering mixed-type jso (with both child and peer victims) separately was also confirmed. more importantly, multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated that adding sibling incest to the equation was useful. jso of intra-familial child were significantly more likely to have been victimized during their own childhood compared to jso with extra-familial victims. nevertheless, adolescents who had committed sibling incest obtained middle ground results on most variables (except for crime severity), suggesting that they constitute a distinct but not extreme, subgroup. this study confirmed the utility of using both the age and the family relation with the victim in characterizing juvenile sexual offending. joyal, christian c. and carpentier, julie and martin, caroline 2016 discriminant factors for adolescent sexual offending: on the usefulness of considering both victim age and sibling incest alter // age;familie // family;inzest // incest;jugendliche t\\\"ater*innen // adolescent sex offender 10-22 54 0145-2134 child abuse \\& neglect article    joyal, c., j. carpentier, and c. martin c. joyal, j. carpentier, c. martin joyal, c. et al. joyal et al. joyal et al."

Statements of the victims, defendants, and witnesses, together with the minutes issued by law enforcement officers, hospital or forensic reports, and arrest warrants were used to collect data. The average values and percentage test analysis were used to assess data. A large portion of the sexually abused children were determined to be between 14 and 17 years of age, female, and had been abused before, while a majority of the abusers were between 19 and 25 years of age, and all of the abusers identified as male. Most of the cases of abuse were planned and carried out under threat, and a certain number of such crimes resulted in pregnancy, were repeated systematically, and became evident when the mothers of the abused children found out or when a pregnant child was referred to a hospital for childbirth.

One hundred and fifty files recorded in the National Judiciary Information System between 2006-2012 relating to cases of child sexual abuse and considered to be within the scope of Offences Against Sexual Integrity pertaining to Turkish Penal Code were analyzed for this research. Statements of the victims, defendants, and witnesses, together with the minutes issued by law enforcement officers, hospital or forensic reports, and arrest warrants were used to collect data. The average values and percentage test analysis were used to assess data. A large portion of the sexually abused children were determined to be between 14 and 17 years of age, female, and had been abused before, while a majority of the abusers were between 19 and 25 years of age, and all of the abusers identified as male. Most of the cases of abuse were planned and carried out under threat, and a certain number of such crimes resulted in pregnancy, were repeated systematically, and became evident when the mothers of the abused children found out or when a pregnant child was referred to a hospital for childbirth. The sexual abuse of children is a significant problem for Turkish society, just as it is for other societies, and it is recommended that further research be conducted with a broader scope in order to present this issue more clearly and to develop solutions.",

Semi-structured interviews were held with 20 people with intellectual disabilities covering topics such as: sex education, relationships, sex, social media, parenthood and support. The reported frequency of sex education the participants receive is low. Their knowledge regarding sex education is mainly limited to topics such as safe sex, contraception and STI's and tends to be superficial. Additionally, knowledge on safe sex does not always translate to safe sex behaviour. Finally, relationships are important for most participants; mainly because they don't want to be alone. Findings from both this study and literature shows that there seems to be a need for high quality sex education. Topics to consider to include are: online relationships, social media and parenthood. It would also be beneficial to focus on sexuality-related skills.

Semi-structured interviews were held with 20 people with intellectual disabilities covering topics such as: sex education, relationships, sex, social media, parenthood and support. The reported frequency of sex education the participants receive is low. Their knowledge regarding sex education is mainly limited to topics such as safe sex, contraception and STI's and tends to be superficial. Additionally, knowledge on safe sex does not always translate to safe sex behaviour. Finally, relationships are important for most participants; mainly because they don't want to be alone. Findings from both this study and literature shows that there seems to be a need for high quality sex education. Topics to consider to include are: online relationships, social media and parenthood. It would also be beneficial to focus on sexuality-related skills. Finally, to increase the effectiveness of a sex education programme, it is advisable that a theory-and evidence-based framework, such as Intervention Mapping, is used for its development.",

Close to half (46\\%) reported suicidal thoughts in the past 3 months. Shame was found to partially mediate the relationship between self-blame and posttraumatic stress disorder. Shame and depressive symptoms were also found to partially mediate the relationship between self-blame and suicidal ideation. Results suggest that shame is a crucial target in interventions designed for sexually abused adolescent girls.",

This may be due to skill deficits in areas including social development, cognitive abilities, emotion regulation and awareness, and communication in both expressive and receptive areas. Delays in each of these areas can impact an individual's ability to navigate healthy sexuality and relationships, partnered or with oneself. Whereas education and intervention can support building capacity for healthy sexuality across the lifespan, there presents a unique opportunity to address both risk-reduction (i.e., addresses the potential victim) and prevention (i.e., addresses the potential perpetrator) by educating one population, that is, all individuals with IDs. Challenges such as the duality of simultaneously being victim and perpetrator, the potential need for education/support and direct consequences, and the balancing act of supporting a potential perpetrator whilst protecting potential victims will be examined in this literature review (Thompson in Health Risk Saf 2(1):33--46, 2000; Fyson in Br J Learn Disabil 35:181--186, 2007).",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15--24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment.

",
    "bibtex": "@article{Jennings.2015,\n    abstract = {The link between child sexual abuse and adult intimate partner violence surfaces throughout prior research. Nonetheless, methodologies investigating this cycle of violence predominantly involve descriptive, correlational, or traditional regression-based analyses that preclude more definitive statements about the empirical relationship between child sexual abuse and adult partner violence.

    "freetext": "student school engagement, or the person--environment fit between a student and the student's school, is a construct that has received increasing attention in the school psychology literature in recent years. however, little research has examined this construct among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (lgbtq) students or analyzed whether factors such as access to safe adults, the presence of a gay--straight alliance (gsa), characteristics of a gsa, or personal involvement in a gsa may connect to engagement. the current study used sequential multiple regression to examine data from a sample of lgbtq high school students (n = 152) from colorado and found that the greater the number of types of safe adults that a student has access to at school, the higher the student's school engagement. gsa presence was not significantly associated with student school engagement. however, among those students whose school had a gsa (n = 91), the larger, more active, more visible, and more supported a gsa was perceived to be, the more these students were engaged at school. personal involvement in a gsa did not predict student school engagement. this article discusses implications for school-based practitioners and future research. seelman, kristie l. and forge, nicholas and walls, n. eugene and bridges, nadine 2015 school engagement among lgbtq high school students: the roles of safe adults and gay--straight alliance characteristics queer;schule // school;soziale unterst\\\"utzung // social support 19-29 57 01907409 children and youth services review 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.07.021 article    seelman, k., n. forge, n. walls, and n. bridges k. seelman, n. forge, n. walls, n. bridges seelman, k. et al. seelman et al. seelman et al."

    "freetext": "dating aggression is a prevalent and costly public health concern. using a relational risk framework, this study examined acute and chronic relational risk factors (negative interactions, jealousy, support, and relationship satisfaction) and their effects on physical and psychological dating aggression. the study also examined the interaction between chronic and acute risk, allowing us to assess how changes in acute risk have differing effects depending on whether the individual is typically at higher chronic risk. a sample of 200 youth (100 female) completed seven waves of data, which spanned 9 years from middle adolescence to young adulthood (m age at wave 1 = 15.83). using hierarchical linear modeling, analyses revealed both acute (within-person) and chronic (between-person) levels in jealousy, negative interactions, and relationship satisfaction, were associated with physical and psychological dating aggression. significant interactions between chronic and acute risk emerged in predicting physical aggression for negative interactions, jealousy, and relationship satisfaction such that those with higher levels of chronic risk are more vulnerable to increases in acute risk. these interactions between chronic and acute risk indicate that risk is not static, and dating aggression is particularly likely to occur at certain times for youth at high risk for dating aggression. such periods of increased risk may provide opportunities for interventions to be particularly effective in preventing dating aggression or its consequences. taken together, these findings provide support for the role of relational risk factors for dating aggression. they also underscore the importance of considering risk dynamically. collibee, charlene and furman, wyndol 2016 chronic and acute relational risk factors for dating aggression in adolescence and young adulthood beziehungsgestaltung // relationships;gewalt in beziehngen // dating violence;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;risikofaktoren // risk factors 763-776 45 4 0047-2891 journal of youth and adolescence 10.1007/s10964-016-0427-0 article    collibee, c. and w. furman c. collibee, w. furman collibee and furman collibee, c. and w. furman collibee &amp; furman"

I draw on findings from qualitative research conducted in Athens with young schoolgirls aged 10--12 years about their favourite popular icons in order to examine the variety of their engagements with, readings and practices of popular culture. Their discursive accounts reveal the intricate ways in which pre-teenage girls make sense of fandom and stardom, discuss taste, fashion and body aesthetics, and construct notions of attractiveness and ethical selfhood.",

    "freetext": "extensive research has examined face-to-face aggression within adolescents' romantic relationships, but little attention has been given to the role of electronic technologies in adolescents' perpetuation of these behaviors. thus, this study examined the relationship of anxious and avoidant partner attachments to partner-directed cyber aggression, assessed 1 year later among 600 adolescents (54\\% female). after accounting for gender and previous behaviors, anxious partner attachment was related to later partner-directed cyber aggression. in addition, insecure parental attachment from adolescents' mothers was related positively to insecure partner attachment and had an indirect effect on their partner-directed cyber aggression through the mediation of anxious partner attachment. this study provides insight into the impact of electronic technologies on adolescents' romantic relationships. wright, michelle f. 2015 cyber aggression within adolescents' romantic relationships: linkages to parental and partner attachment 37-47 44 1 0047-2891 journal of youth and adolescence 10.1007/s10964-014-0147-2 article    wright, m. m. wright wright, m. wright wright "

    "freetext": "numerous studies demonstrate that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) children and youth are likely to experience abuse by peers, parents, and other adults and that these experiences correlate with a host of mental health problems. however, there is little understanding of the experiences of lgbt children and youth living in countries where social and legal protections for sexual and gender minorities are limited or nonexistent. this qualitative study used thematic analysis to explore the child and adolescent abuse experiences and their impact on the pre-migration mental health of lgbt forced migrants. we analyzed 26 interviews with individuals who obtained refugee or asylee status in the united states or canada on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. participants originated from countries in asia, africa, the caribbean, eastern europe, latin america, and the middle east. analysis revealed the following themes: abuse by parents and caregivers, abuse by peers and school personnel, having nowhere to turn, and dealing with psychological distress. findings indicate that participants experienced severe verbal, physical, and sexual abuse throughout childhood and adolescence and that this abuse occurred at home, in school, and in the community. furthermore, there were no resources or sources of protection available to them. participants linked their abuse to subjective experiences of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. we conclude with implications for refugee adjudication practices, mental health care, and international policy. alessi, edward j. and kahn, sarilee and chatterji, sangeeta 2016 `the darkest times of my life': recollections of child abuse among forced migrants persecuted because of their sexual orientation and gender identity kinder- und jugendschutz // child protection;kindesmissbrauch // child abuse;migration;queer;sexueller kindesmissbrauch 93-105 51 0145-2134 child abuse \\& neglect article    alessi, e., s. kahn, and s. chatterji e. alessi, s. kahn, s. chatterji alessi, e. et al. alessi et al. alessi et al."

The children were aged 8--13 years. The children's parent were surveyed using questionnaires [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI)] to obtain demographic information, traumatic event profiles and self-report scale. Children completed psychological measures as follows: Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Traumatic Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). The modified-Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) was used to assess children's statements. ANOVA, independent t-test, Pearson correlation were used. All statistics were demonstrated using SPSS 12.0.\n\nResults: Modified-CBCA scores did not differ according to children's level of depression and anxiety. Children with parents who showed supportive reactions, scored significantly higher on the modified-CBCA scores than those with unsupportive parents. Children with severely depressed parents had lower modified-CBCA scores than those with less depressed parents. Modified-CBCA scores were significantly higher in participants who experienced a single traumatic event than those who had multiple events. However, the severity of sexual abuse, relationship with the perpetrator, types of disclosure, and duration of initial disclosure did not show significant differences in capability of statement.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, the competence of statements in Korean sexually child sex abuse victims is related to parental emotional states and support rather than children's factors such as psychopathology or age, and appears to be more reliable with a single traumatic experience.

    "freetext": "developing a sexual self-concept is an important developmental task of adolescence; however, little empirical evidence describes this development, nor how these changes are related to development in sexual behavior. using longitudinal cohort data from adolescent women, we invoked latent growth curve analysis to: (1) examine reciprocal development in sexual self-concept (sexual openness, sexual esteem and sexual anxiety) over a four year time frame; (2) describe the relationship of these trajectories with changes in sexual behavior. we found significant transactional effects between these dimensions and behavior: sexual self-concept evolved during adolescence in a manner consistent with less reserve, less anxiety and greater personal comfort with sexuality and sexual behavior. moreover, we found that sexual self-concept results from sexual behavior, as well as regulates future behavior. hensel, devon j. and fortenberry, j. dennis and o'sullivan, lucia f. and orr, donald p. 2011 the developmental association of sexual self-concept with sexual behavior among adolescent women jugendliche und junge erwachsene;m\\\"adchen // girls;selbstkonzept // self-concept;sexuelles verhalten // sexual behaviour 675-684 34 4 0140-1971 journal of adolescence 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.09.005 article    hensel, d., j. fortenberry, l. o'sullivan, and d. orr d. hensel, j. fortenberry, l. o'sullivan, d. orr hensel, d. et al. hensel et al. hensel et al."

On average, the teachers were only somewhat willing to teach SHE and their willingness varied between topics. The teachers who reported greater willingness to teach SHE were more likely to be teaching middle school, have less teaching experience, have received training to teach SHE, feel more knowledgeable about sexual health, and view broad-based SHE as more important. More than 20\\% of participants identified 10 out of 11 factors as making them less willing to teach sexual health education; conversely, more than 20\\% of participants identified nine of these 11 factors as making them more willing to teach sexual health education. Teachers who were middle school teachers, had received training to teach sexual health, had more experience teaching SHE, and felt more knowledgeable about sexual health topics were more likely to regard all of these factors as enhancing their willingness to teach SHE. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for training designed to increase teachers' willingness to teach sexual health.",

    "freetext": "for many lesbian teachers and students there are issues and dilemmas that challenge them being `out' in school environments. the purpose of this paper is to describe and explore the experiences of two lesbians in this context. this is a descriptive case study involving semi-structured interviews and conversations. the teacher and a student in the teacher's class in 1990 recall and contrast their experiences 20 years later when they both identified as lesbian, although neither had acknowledged this to the other in the classroom. at that time the teacher's management of identities contrasted with the student's attitude to her own developing sexuality. these original experiences and later reflections are linked to explore wider issues for lesbians in primary schools. issues and dilemmas for lesbian teachers and students 20 years ago continue to be debated: whether to be out; to be a role-model; and what is private and professional information. teaching diversity and providing inclusive education are ongoing concerns. hardie, ann 2011 lesbian teachers and students: issues and dilemmas of being `out' in primary school diversity;lehrer*innen // teachers;sexualit\\\"at // sexuality 1-10 1472-0825 sex education: sexuality, society and learning 10.1080/14681811.2011.615595 article    hardie, a. a. hardie hardie, a. hardie hardie"

The results revealed that respondents who survived rape and child prostitution were more symptomatic than those who were married early. Respondents for whom less time had elapsed since their first experience of abuse demonstrated a significantly higher level of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, negative reactions by others, self-blame, and guilt than those for whom more time had elapsed since such an experience. The respondents in an intact marital relationship were found to be less symptomatic than their never married and divorced counterparts. Implications for intervention and further investigations are discussed.",

    "freetext": "this paper has been inspired by the processes of preparing for ethical scrutiny and seeking ethical approval for a series of studies examining causal mechanisms that might facilitate sexual revictimisation. the focus here is on just four of the issues that arose in the context of the first study: a web-based survey. one of the aims of the survey is to test whether victims of child sexual abuse who experienced a period of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia demonstrate an exaggerated risk for adolescent/adult sexual assault during this amnesic phase. that is, cases where survivors report `suddenly remembering' in adulthood that they were abused as children, but state that prior to this `remembering' they had no prior knowledge of their abuse. the study design is considered to be the first ethical issue. to enhance the methodological robustness a strategy has been employed to reduce the erroneous inclusion of currently amnesic participants in the non-abused comparison group. secondly, consideration is given to the likely harms and benefits that might be incurred or bestowed upon the participants. thirdly, problems of both re-traumatisation and vicarious traumatisation in relation to the researcher are contemplated and juxtaposed against the possibility of the facilitation of post-traumatic growth and a personal shift towards wisdom and generativity. finally, the survey title was originally criticised as negating `fully' informed consent and a defence is therefore offered that ultimately gained ethical approval. it is hoped that these deliberations and insights may prove useful to others in planning their own research and ethics proposals. wager, nadia 2011 researching sexual revictimisation: associated ethical and methodological issues, and possible solutions forschungsethik // research ethics;revictimisierung // revictimization;sexueller missbrauch // sexual abuse;trauma // trauma 158-172 20 3 09529136 child abuse review 10.1002/car.1152 article    wager, n. n. wager wager, n. wager wager"

    "freetext": "this article explores the professional boundaries guidance for social workers. it presents research findings from the formal literature, from agency codes of practice, from telephone interviews with regulatory and professional bodies and from an exercise using `snowballing techniques' in which informants responded to brief scenarios illustrating boundary dilemmas. the findings suggest that formal research plays little part in the guidance that individuals use to help them determine professional boundaries. similarly, only 10--15 per cent of informants made regular reference to regulatory and professional codes of practice, with an even smaller percentage quoting specific sections from these codes. a slightly larger group (15--20 per cent) made fairly regular reference to their agency's policy documents. however, a clear majority relied on their own sense of what is appropriate or inappropriate, and made their judgements with no reference to any formal guidance. agency guidance tended to ignore the ambiguous areas of practice and seemed to act as an insurance policy, brought out and dusted off when something goes awry. the authors caution against ever-increasing bullet points of advice and prescription, and advance a notion of ethical engagement in which professionals exercise their ethical senses through regular discussion of professional boundary dilemmas. doel, mark and allmark, peter and conway, paul and cowburn, malcolm and flynn, margaret and nelson, pete and tod, angela 2010 professional boundaries: crossing a line or entering the shadows? n\\\"ahe / distanz;professionalit\\\"at // professionality;soziale arbeit und dienste // social work and services 1866-1889 40 6 1468-263x the british journal of social work article    doel, m., p. allmark, p. conway, m. cowburn, m. flynn, p. nelson, and a. tod m. doel, p. allmark, p. conway, m. cowburn, m. flynn, p. nelson, a. tod doel, m. et al. doel et al. doel et al."

The majority of studies reviewed originated in North America and Asia, were quantitative, surveyed mainly mothers and were more than ten years old. Recommendations are made for more current and country specific research, further research to gain a deeper understanding of how parents manage the risk of child sexual abuse, more comprehensive research covering a range of knowledge, attitude and practice variables, and greater inclusion of fathers in research.

The more knowledge parents have about CSA, the greater likelihood they can create safer environments for their children and thus prevent the occurrence of sexual exploitation. Research has demonstrated that parents lack crucial information about CSA and can benefit from even brief educational efforts. This paper will identify potential barriers to participation and offer practical suggestions for enhancing both recruitment and retention rates.

Similarly, photo-methods are an unconventional data collection method in educational research associated with `risk' in school settings. Given this context, why use photo-methods in research on sexualities and schooling? While acknowledging the challenges of using photo-methods in school-based research I suggest their capacity to disclose qualitatively different insights about this field. These findings are drawn from the use of photo-diaries and photo-elicitation in a project examining the sexual cultures of two New Zealand secondary schools. The value of these methods lies in their ability to explore broader features of sexualities and schooling than the official curriculum, policy and classroom practices. These methods can reveal embodied and spatial dimensions of sexuality which inhere in the unofficial minutiae of everyday schooling experiences. The participant driven process of taking photos can facilitate access to what some researchers conceptualize as the `unknown, unknowns'. For those concerned with the educative potential of research, photo-diaries might also be helpful in generating participants' critical reflection of an otherwise taken-for-granted lived reality.},\n    author = {Allen, Louisa},\n    year = {2011},\n    title = {'Picture this': Using photo-methods in research on sexualities and schooling},\n    keyword = {Forschung;Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene;Schule // school;Schulklima // school climate;Sexualit{\\\"a}t // sexuality;Sexualkultur // sexuality culture},\n    pages = {487--504},\n    volume = {11},\n    number = {5},\n    issn = {1468-7941},\n    journal = {Qualitative Research},\n    doi = {10.1177/1468794111413224}\n}",

Given this context, why use photo-methods in research on sexualities and schooling? While acknowledging the challenges of using photo-methods in school-based research I suggest their capacity to disclose qualitatively different insights about this field. These findings are drawn from the use of photo-diaries and photo-elicitation in a project examining the sexual cultures of two New Zealand secondary schools. The value of these methods lies in their ability to explore broader features of sexualities and schooling than the official curriculum, policy and classroom practices. These methods can reveal embodied and spatial dimensions of sexuality which inhere in the unofficial minutiae of everyday schooling experiences. The participant driven process of taking photos can facilitate access to what some researchers conceptualize as the `unknown, unknowns'. For those concerned with the educative potential of research, photo-diaries might also be helpful in generating participants' critical reflection of an otherwise taken-for-granted lived reality.",

Although this area has received considerable research attention, more studies with representative samples are needed to assure that findings are reflective of populations of interest. A representative statewide sample of households with adolescents (N = 907) from a large and diverse state in the United States was employed to examine the content and extent of sexual communication between parents and their adolescents, and the influence of selected primary demographic (age and gender), socio-demographic (Hispanic ethnicity, education, and religious attendance), and psychological (self-reported comfort, knowledge, and sexual communication difficulties) factors on the number of topics discussed.

    "freetext": "sexual beliefs, behaviors and identities are interwoven throughout our lives, from childhood to old age. an edited collection of original empirical contributions united through its use of a distinctive, cutting-edge theoretical framework, sex for life critically examines sexuality across the entire lifespan. rooted in diverse disciplines and employing a wide range of research methods, the chapters explore the sexual and social transitions that typically map to broad life stages, as well as key age-graded physiological transitions, such as puberty and menopause, while drawing on the latest developments in gender, sexuality, and life course studies.sex for life explores a wide variety of topics, including puberty, sexual initiation, coming out, sexual assault, marriage/life partnering, disability onset, immigration, divorce, menopause, and widowhood, always attending to the social locations including gender, race, ethnicity, and social class that shape, and are shaped by, sexuality. the empirical work collected in sex for life ultimately speaks to important public policy issues, such as sex education, aging societies, and the increasing politicization of scientific research. accessibly written, the contributions capture the interplay between individual lives and the ever-changing social-historical context, facilitating new insight not only into people s sexual lives, but also into ways of studying them, ultimately providing a fresh, new perspective on sexuality.\\dq 2012 sex for life: from virginity to viagra, how sexuality changes throughout our lives psychologie // psychology;sexuelle gesundheit // sexual health;sexuelles verhalten // sexual behaviour new york new york university press 0814723810 intersections carpenter, laura m. and delamater, john d. book new york          carpenter, l. and j. delamater l. carpenter &amp; j. delamater eds."

Logistic regression and multivariate analysis of covariance were used to test for sex differences in abuse characteristics, and to determine whether sex moderated associations between abuse characteristics and emotional and behavioral problems. RESULTS: Girls were more likely than boys to have their abuse substantiated and to experience penetrative abuse (although differences in penetration status did not emerge among adolescents).

Sex did not moderate the relationship between abuse characteristics and youth emotional and behavioral problems.

    "freetext": "objective: the first objective of this study was to test for sex differences in four childhood sexual abuse characteristics-penetration, substantiation, perpetrator familial status, and multi-maltreatment-in a national sample of youth. the second objective was to test for sex differences in how these abuse characteristics were associated with victims' emotional and behavioral problems. methods: the sample was drawn from the national survey of child and adolescent well-being, a sample of children investigated by united states child welfare services. youth in the current study (n=573, including 234 adolescents) were investigated for alleged sexual abuse. logistic regression and multivariate analysis of covariance were used to test for sex differences in abuse characteristics, and to determine whether sex moderated associations between abuse characteristics and emotional and behavioral problems. results: girls were more likely than boys to have their abuse substantiated and to experience penetrative abuse (although differences in penetration status did not emerge among adolescents). substantiation status and child age were positively associated with caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. sex did not moderate the relationship between abuse characteristics and youth emotional and behavioral problems. conclusions: sexual abuse characteristics might not be highly predictive factors when making decisions about services needs. furthermore, there may not be a strong empirical basis for operating on the assumption that one sex is more vulnerable to negative consequences of abuse than the other, or that abuse affects girls and boys differently. the processes explaining why some victims exhibit more impairment than others are likely complex. maikovich-fong, andrea kohn and jaffee, sara r. 2010 sex differences in childhood sexual abuse characteristics and victims' emotional and behavioral problems: findings from a national sample of youth folgen // long-term effects;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;sexueller kindesmissbrauch 429-437 34 6 0145-2134 child abuse \\& neglect 10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.10.006 article    maikovich-fong, a. and s. jaffee a. maikovich-fong, s. jaffee maikovich-fong and jaffee maikovich-fong, a. and s. jaffee maikovich-fong &amp; jaffee"

The current study used the sexual self-schema construct to examine cognitive representations of sexuality that might drive these behavioral patterns. In Study 1 (N = 774), we attempted to improve the content validity of the Sexual Self Schema Scale for child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors, introducing a fourth sexual self-schema factor titled the {\\dq}immoral/irresponsible{\\dq} factor. In Study 2 (N = 1150), the potential differences in sexual self-views, as assessed by the four sexual self-schema factors, between CSA survivors and non-victims were explored. In addition, Study 2 evaluated how these sexual self-schema differences may contribute to participation in unrestricted sexual behaviors and risk for sexual assault in adolescence. Results indicated that a history of CSA impacted the way women viewed themselves as a sexual person on each of the four factors. CSA survivors were found to view themselves as more open and possessing more immoral/irresponsible cognitions about sexuality as compared to women who did not have a CSA history. In addition, the CSA survivors endorsed less embarrassment and passionate/romantic views of their sexual selves. The interaction of CSA severity and the sexual self-schemas explained variance in adolescent sexual assault experiences above and beyond the severity of CSA history and participation in risky sexual behaviors. The findings suggest that sexual self-views may serve to moderate the relationship between CSA and adolescent sexual assault.

In Study 1 (N = 774), we attempted to improve the content validity of the Sexual Self Schema Scale for child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors, introducing a fourth sexual self-schema factor titled the \\dqimmoral/irresponsible\\dq factor. In Study 2 (N = 1150), the potential differences in sexual self-views, as assessed by the four sexual self-schema factors, between CSA survivors and non-victims were explored. In addition, Study 2 evaluated how these sexual self-schema differences may contribute to participation in unrestricted sexual behaviors and risk for sexual assault in adolescence. Results indicated that a history of CSA impacted the way women viewed themselves as a sexual person on each of the four factors. CSA survivors were found to view themselves as more open and possessing more immoral/irresponsible cognitions about sexuality as compared to women who did not have a CSA history. In addition, the CSA survivors endorsed less embarrassment and passionate/romantic views of their sexual selves. The interaction of CSA severity and the sexual self-schemas explained variance in adolescent sexual assault experiences above and beyond the severity of CSA history and participation in risky sexual behaviors. The findings suggest that sexual self-views may serve to moderate the relationship between CSA and adolescent sexual assault. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",

Sexual minority youth with strong family relationships may demonstrate resilience and increased well-being; however, it is also possible that the experience of sexual stigma may make these relationships less protective for sexual minority youth.

Specifically, we examine whether lower levels of parental closeness, parental involvement, and family support among same-sex attracted youth explain in part why these youth experience increased depressive symptoms and risk behaviors, including binge drinking, illegal drug use, and running away from home, relative to other-sex attracted youth. Second, we ask whether family relationships are equally protective against depressive symptoms and risk behaviors for same-sex attracted and other-sex attracted youth. We find that same-sex attracted youth, particularly girls, report higher levels of depressive symptoms, binge drinking, and drug use in part because they perceive less closeness with parents and less support from their families. Results also suggest that parental closeness and parental involvement may be less protective against risk behaviors for same-sex attracted boys than for their other-sex attracted peers. Findings thus suggest that interventions targeting the families of sexual minority youth should educate parents about the potentially negative effects of heteronormative assumptions and attitudes on positive adolescent development.},\n    author = {Pearson, Jennifer and Wilkinson, Lindsey},\n    year = {2013},\n    title = {Family relationships and adolescent well-being: are families equally protective for same-sex attracted youth?},\n    pages = {376--393},\n    volume = {42},\n    number = {3},\n    issn = {0047-2891},\n    journal = {Journal of Youth and Adolescence},\n    doi = {10.1007/s10964-012-9865-5}\n}",

Specifically, we examine whether lower levels of parental closeness, parental involvement, and family support among same-sex attracted youth explain in part why these youth experience increased depressive symptoms and risk behaviors, including binge drinking, illegal drug use, and running away from home, relative to other-sex attracted youth. Second, we ask whether family relationships are equally protective against depressive symptoms and risk behaviors for same-sex attracted and other-sex attracted youth. We find that same-sex attracted youth, particularly girls, report higher levels of depressive symptoms, binge drinking, and drug use in part because they perceive less closeness with parents and less support from their families. Results also suggest that parental closeness and parental involvement may be less protective against risk behaviors for same-sex attracted boys than for their other-sex attracted peers. Findings thus suggest that interventions targeting the families of sexual minority youth should educate parents about the potentially negative effects of heteronormative assumptions and attitudes on positive adolescent development.",

Studies that were conducted on this issue mainly focused on the offenders' profile and prevention strategies.\n\nThe aim of the current paper is to characterize the narratives of alleged victims of child sexual abuse using the testimonies of twenty children who were referred to investigative interviews following suspected sexual abuse through the Internet.

    "freetext": "child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence may have a significant impact on parenting. the current study expands on existing research by examining the effects of child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence on parenting styles and parenting self-efficacy. in women from a parenting intervention program (n = 20), child sexual abuse was related to lower parenting self-efficacy and more permissive parenting. in women at a domestic violence shelter (n = 45), child sexual abuse was related to current sexual coercion of the partner, and authoritative parenting was related to higher parenting self-efficacy. these results indicate that having a history of child sexual abuse should be taken into consideration when dealing with mothers in violent relationships. jaffe, anna e. and cranston, christopher c. and shadlow, joanna o. 2012 parenting in females exposed to intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse coercion;eltern;erwachsene;female;humans;kinder;male;self concept;sexueller kindesmissbrauch;single parent/psychology;spouse abuse/psychology;von sexuellem kindesmissbrauch betroffene;young adult 684-700 21 6 1053-8712 journal of child sexual abuse 10.1080/10538712.2012.726698 article    jaffe, a., c. cranston, and j. shadlow a. jaffe, c. cranston, j. shadlow jaffe, a. et al. jaffe et al. jaffe et al."

    "freetext": "scant attention has been given to the consequence of actual weight status for adolescents' sexual wellbeing. in this article, we investigate the race-specific connection between obesity and risky sexual behavior among adolescent girls. propensity scores and radius matching are used to analyze a sample of 340 adolescents aged 16-17 who participated in the national longitudinal survey of youth young adult survey in 2000 or 2002. nearly even numbers of these participants identified as white and black (183 and 157, respectively). we find that compared to their non-obese white peers, obese white adolescent girls exhibit higher rates of multiple sex partners and sex with older partners, and are also less likely to use condoms. none of these factors are significantly related to high bmi within the black sample. these findings indicate that the negative social consequences of obesity extend beyond future economic and marriage outcomes to adolescent white women's sexual outcomes. they also highlight the importance of context: the implications of being obese during adolescence depend on cultural meanings of obesity. leech, tamara g. j. and dias, janice johnson 2012 risky sexual behavior: a race-specific social consequence of obesity ethnizit\\\"at // ethnicity;gesundheit // health;jugendliche und junge erwachsene;risikoverhalten // risk behavior;sexuelles verhalten // sexual behaviour 41-52 41 1 0047-2891 journal of youth and adolescence 10.1007/s10964-011-9670-6 article    leech, t. and j. dias t. leech, j. dias leech and dias leech, t. and j. dias leech &amp; dias"
